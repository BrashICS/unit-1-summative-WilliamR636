        <h1>Herman's Importance</h1>

        <h2>His innovations and involvement</h2>

        <p>Herman Hollerith would prove to be a very important figure in the realms of Computer Science and Engineering. His innovations of punched-cards and tabulators into machine processing propelled computing into the 1950s, until further innovations made his machines obsolete, and prevented the U.S Census Bureau from becoming non-functional. He created the Tabulating Machine Company in 1896, which would go off to be bought in a merger by Thomas Watson, and create the International Business Machines Company in 1924.<br><br>There is also many seldom mentioned reasons as to why he was so influential. He showcased the power and potential of computing to many corporations and countries around the world, and managed to expedite many of their operations, which gave them a leg up on their competitors in their respective fields of business/governance.</p>
