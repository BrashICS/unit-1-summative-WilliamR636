        <h1>Herman's Life</h1>

        <h2>Early Life</h2>

        <p>Herman Hollerith was born the 29th of Febuary, 1860 in Buffalo, New York. His parents were German and he graduated from the Columbia University School of Mines in 1879. He became an assistant to his  teacher, William P. Trowbridge, who worked on the 1880 U.S census, where he proceeded to work for 10 years alongside teaching at the Massachusetts Ministry of Technology, experimenting on air brakes for the U.S government, and performing work for the U.S Patent Office.</p>

        <h2>Tabulating Machines</h2>

        <p>In late 1887, while Herman Hollerith was working for the U.S Patent Office, he was able see the conditions of the U.S Census, and realised that if trends continues, the census would be unable to complete the 1890 census before the 1900s census was set to begin. Seeing this, he believed that there was profit to be made if he could create a machine to expedite the process of tallying the census, and so in 1886, he innovated on his previous processing device, adding a punched-card system to record data alongside a tabulator to analyse and record the data on the punched-cards. He was able to reveal his machine to the 1990 census board in 1887 by joining a competition to see which machine could analyse the data-table provided the quickest. He won, and soon proceeded to rent his tabulating machines to many prominent companies and countries, including but not limited to;<br>
        Standard Oil, Canada, Austria, Russia, Norway, Cuba, France, Britain, and the Philippines.</p>

        <h2>TMC and IBM</h2>

        <p>In 1896, Herman Hollerith, alongside friends and investors, created the Tabulating Machine Company. It quickly grew sucessful and proceeded to dominate the Tabulating Machine market over the next decade. The company's business model was based on renting out their tabulating machines to prominent people and companies, like Standard Oil, and charging them massive sums for the rental. In 1905, the U.S Census bureau decided against renting TMC's expensive tabulators, and opted instead to reverse-engineer their own machines, using TMC's tabulators as a base. This dealt a heavy blow to TMC, who was unable to pursue legal action on account of the U.S Census Bureau narrowly dodging patent infringement, and thus began looking for new customers. In 1911, Herman Hollerith sold his shares to TMC for $1,210,500 U.S dollars (~$23,000,000 U.S today) and effectively retired from his company, although he would continue to act as director and earn a $20,000 U.S salary until his legal retirement in 1921. During his retirement, he enjoyed farming guernsey cattle for fun, while TMC would go on to be bought in a merger, and proceed to form the International Business Machines Corporation.
